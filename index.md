Yiming Li is a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Wuhan University (Advisor: Prof. [Zhenzhong Chen]). His major research interests are video coding strandard (H.265/HEVC, AVS2, AVS2-3D, etc.), virtual reality video compression, perceptual video coding and video transmission. He started pursuing his Ph.D. degree in [IISC] Lab from 2017.

He holds a B.E. in Remote Sensing Engineering from Wuhan university, where he was awarded the Top 10 Stars of Remote Sensing (Research Category). From February 2016 to March 2017, he was a research intern in MC group at Microsoft Research Asia, supervised by Dr. Jizheng Xu.
